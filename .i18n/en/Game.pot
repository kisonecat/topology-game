msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L01
msgid "In mathematics, a `TopologicalSpace` is a `Set` paired\n"
"with a family of \"open subsets\". This family, called a topology,\n"
"must satisfy three axioms. The first is that the entire set itself\n"
"must be an open subset."

msgid "By definition, the universe `univ` is always open in a topological\n"
"space."

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L01
msgid "There's nothing to prove here. `IsOpen univ` is `exact`ly the\n"
"first axiom of `X` being a topological space.\n"
"\n"
"To say this in Lean, write `exact h.isOpen_univ`. The `exact`\n"
"tactic says that the goal is exactly a known fact. Our hypothesis\n"
"`h` is that `X` is a topological space, and `h.isOpen_univ`\n"
"specifically says that the universe of this topological space is open."

msgid "The Intersection Axiom"

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L02
msgid "The next axiom of topological spaces is that\n"

msgid "By definition, the intersection of two open sets is open."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L02
msgid "Again, we have little to prove here: this should just be\n"
"intersection axiom. The way this theorem is stated\n"
"in Lean is a little different than the way it's expressed here, however.\n"
"(Try typing `exact h.isOpen_inter` and see what happens!)\n"
"\n"
"So it's not `exact`ly the same, but `h.isOpen_inter` is certainly still\n"
"applicable! In fact, we can use the `apply` tactic here rather than\n"
"`exact`..."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L02
msgid "Great! By `apply`ing `h.isOpen_inter`, you've reduced our goal to show\n"
"`IsOpen (U ‚à© V)` into two subgoals. The first subgoal is `IsOpen U`, which\n"
"is `exact`ly one of our hypotheses..."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L02
msgid "And the second subgoal is also a given hypothesis."

msgid "Proving Something New!"
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L03
msgid "Of course, if the intersection of two opens must be open,\n"
"we should be able to prove three open sets have open intersection."

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L03

msgid "Inductive Arguments"
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L04
msgid "We could now prove `IsOpen (U ‚à© V ‚à© W ‚à© S)`, but the smarter play\n"
"is to prove any finite intersection is open."

msgid "Splits up an intersection over a successor ordinal into a binary\n"
"intersection of with the last element and the rest of the intersection."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L04
msgid "Informally, in this scenario we have $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$,\n"
"and open sets $U_n$ is open for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n"
"We wish to prove that $\\bigcap_{m\\leq n} U_m$ is open."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L04
msgid "To prove this, we will need to use induction. This is possible\n"
"using mathlib's `induction'` tactic. (There is also an `induction` tactic,\n"
"but this variation allows for a cleaner proof.) Try using\n"
"`induction' n with n hn` to split your goal into a base case and\n"
"a successor case."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L04
msgid "This base case is trivial, but would be tedious to work through explicitly.\n"
"Fortunately, we can use the `simp` tactic to help us out. Just run `simp`\n"
"and Lean will automatically prove the base case for us by realizing this\n"
"is an intersection over an empty collection, which is equal to `univ`,\n"
"which is always open."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L04
msgid "Now here, `simp` is not smart enough to prove this case for us.\n"
"However, we can use the `biInter_lt_succ` lemma to `rewrite` the goal\n"
"into a binary intersection which we can handle given our induction hypothesis.\n"
"Try `rw [biInter_lt_succ]` to see how this works."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L04
msgid "Remember how to turn a goal asking to prove that the binary intersection of\n"
"two sets is open into a goal asking to prove that each of the two sets\n"
"is open?"
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L04
msgid "This is exactly our induction hypothesis, which we named `hn`."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L04
msgid "Here we can `apply` the hypothesis `U_open`, or we could note that\n"

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L05
msgid "So of course, a finite union of open sets should be open. To convince\n"
"Lean of this, we will need to first convert this binary union `U ‚à™ V` into the union\n"
"of a set: `‚ãÉ‚ÇÄ {U, V}`."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L05
msgid "The fact that `‚ãÉ‚ÇÄ {U, V} = U ‚à™ V` is captured by `sUnion_pair U V`, but the\n"
