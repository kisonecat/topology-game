msgid "In mathematics, a `TopologicalSpace` is a `Set` paired\n"
"with a family of \"open subsets\". This family, called a topology,\n"
"must satisfy three axioms. The first is that the entire set itself\n"
"must be an open subset."

msgid "By definition, the universe `univ` is always open in a topological\n"

msgid "There's nothing to prove here. `IsOpen univ` is `exact`ly the\n"
"first axiom of `X` being a topological space.\n"
"\n"
"To say this in Lean, write `exact h.isOpen_univ`. The `exact`\n"
"tactic says that the goal is exactly a known fact. Our hypothesis\n"
"`h` is that `X` is a topological space, and `h.isOpen_univ`\n"
"specifically says that the universe of this topological space is open."

msgid "By definition, the intersection of two open sets is open."

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L02
msgid "Again, we have little to prove here: this should just be\n"
"intersection axiom. The way this theorem is stated\n"
"in Lean is a little different than the way it's expressed here, however.\n"
"(Try typing `exact h.isOpen_inter` and see what happens!)\n"
"\n"
"So it's not `exact`ly the same, but `h.isOpen_inter` is certainly still\n"
"applicable! In fact, we can use the `apply` tactic here rather than\n"
"`exact`..."
msgstr ""

#: Game.Levels.SpaceWorld.L02
msgid "Great! By `apply`ing `h.isOpen_inter`, you've reduced our goal to show\n"
"`IsOpen (U âˆ© V)` into two subgoals. The first subgoal is `IsOpen U`, which\n"
"is `exact`ly one of our hypotheses..."
